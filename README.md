# Schedule-application
This is a very basic Daily Schedule planner its was made to practice using time.js and dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
the way it works it you are shown the curren date at the top of the page then you are shown a daily schedule from 9Am - 5Pm this will update changing the color of the background denpending on the time of day for example grey will be in the past red will be the present and green the future you can click on one of the sections and type in an upcuming event, when you click the coresponding save button the text content will be saved to your local storage and will be displayed no matter if you refresh or close the page if saved succesfully it will display a message saying so.
